# FaceFusion-AI-Deepfake-Google-Colab-Jupyter-Notebook

As the official FaceFusion Colabs won't be supported anymore, because FaceFusion uses Paid Clouds like ThinkDiffusion & RunDiffusion, you can use those UI & NO UI Google Colabs.

The new FaceFusion update 2.4.1 made some issues with the encoding of the output deepfake videos, so in this repo there's a fixed version, idk why but also older versions of FaceFusion now gets also the same problem lol

Credits: [Nick088](https://linktr.ee/Nick088) (making the no ui one and now taking support unofficially of FaceFusion colabs), Lusbert (Fixing the Encoding Output Deepfake), [Original FaceFusion team](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion) (for making the program and the old ui colab before they stopped giving support)
